# Examination 4 - Install a Web Server

Now that we know how to install software on a machine through Ansible, we can
begin to look at how to set up a machine with services.

A typical use case is how to get a web server up and running, and coincidentally
we happen to have one of our hosts named `webserver`.

As in the previous examination, we can use the [ansible.builtin.package](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/package_module.html)
module to install the prerequisite software.

Create a new file, you can call it what you like, but in the example below, it's referred to as
`webserver.yml`.

    ---
    - name: Install a webserver
      hosts: web
      become: true
      tasks:
        - name: Ensure nginx is installed
          ansible.builtin.package:
            name: nginx
            state: latest

        - name: Ensure nginx is started at boot
          ansible.builtin.service:
            name: nginx
            enabled: true

The above is a playbook that will install [nginx](https://nginx.org/), a piece of software that can
act as a HTTP server, reverse proxy, content cache, load balancer, and more.

Now, we can run `curl` to see if web server does what we want it to (serve HTTP pages on TCP port 80):

    $ curl -v http://<IP ADDRESS OF THE WEBSERVER>

Change the text within '<' and '>' to the actual IP address of the web server. It may work with the
name of the server too, but this depends on how `libvirt` and DNS is set up on your machine.

Is the response what we expected?

    $ curl -v http://192.168.121.10
    *   Trying 192.168.121.10:80...
    * connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 from 192.168.121.1 port 46036 failed: Connection refused
    * Failed to connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 after 0 ms: Could not connect to server
    * closing connection #0
    curl: (7) Failed to connect to 192.168.121.10 port 80 after 0 ms: Could not connect to server

# QUESTION A

Refer to the documentation for the [ansible.builtin.service](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/service_module.html)
module.

How can we make the web server start with an addition of just one line to the playbook above?

Answer: under the ansible.builtin.service: there is a line that is missing, this is the state line. it should say - state: started. The state command and the enabled command must be written down on the playbook/yml file for the connecton to start, as it is stated in on the ansible.builtin.service web guide under the parameter infomration on the state command. 

# QUESTION B

You make have noted that the `become: true` statement has moved from a specific task to the beginning
of the playbook, and is on the same indentation level as `tasks:`.

What does this accomplish?

become: true is used to grant a task permission to execute with sudo (elevated) rights. When become: true is placed higher up in the playbook, at the same level as tasks:, it means that all tasks under that playbook will automatically run with sudo privileges, without needing to specify it for each individual task.

# QUESTION C

Copy the above playbook to a new playbook. Call it `04-uninstall-webserver.yml`.

Change the ordering of the two tasks. Make the web server stop, and disable it from starting at boot, and
make sure that `nginx` is uninstalled. Change the `name:` parameter of each task accordingly.

Run the new playbook, then make sure that the web server is not running (you can use `curl` for this), and
log in to the machine and make sure that there are no `nginx` processes running.

Why did we change the order of the tasks in the `04-uninstall-webserver.yml` playbook?

Answer: The reason i had to change the order is to make sure that when we unistall the nginx it would not be acitve, becuase it could cause a conflict under the installment, so it is safer to stop the nginx porcess befor uninstalling. 

# BONUS QUESTION

Consider the output from the tasks above, and what we were actually doing on the machine.

What is a good naming convention for tasks? (What SHOULD we write in the `name:` field`?)

Answer: the name: parameter should allways describe what the task actually does. each task might do diffrent things and it is crucial that the name parameter gives som typ of information about what the task is about to do, so that the next devoleper dont have to spend unnecessary trying to figure out what each task does.
